    <p>I'm now studying at the Universidad de Manila; 
    I'm not sure if I'll be able to manage it, but I'll do my best. One of the biggest challenges of my college life 
    is managing my time effectively. You will have to balance your academic work with other responsibilities such as work, 
    extracurricular activities, and socializing. This can be difficult, but it is also an opportunity to develop my skills such as time 
    management and prioritization. Another challenge of college life is dealing with the academic workload. College courses are more 
    demanding than high school courses, and you will be expected to do a lot of independent work. However, this is also an opportunity 
    to explore new subjects and ideas that you may not have been exposed to before.</p>
