    <p>I'm so happy in my grade school days that I don't consider any problems
        but just play and play until I'm tired then I'll go home and eat. My grade school are 
        learning how to interact with others and how to express. Iâ€™m also learning how to read 
        and write, which is a crucial part of my education.
