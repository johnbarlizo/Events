    <p>Accidents happen to everyone at some point in their life. But some accidents are more embarrassing than others. I remember one time when I had an accident that left me is when i ran over in motor in my bike. I crashed to the ground, but just my hands were hurt. My bike was damaged and the handlebars were not even, and I was too humiliated to ride it because so many people saw it. I'm not sure who to look for assistance at the moment and I called my father. I've learned where I'm going to concentrate on the road and not rush.
